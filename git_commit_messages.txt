Git commit messages

Always inlcude a line between the subject and the body of the message.
When creating commit messages use imperative mood in the subject line.
Which means write as if you're giving a command. "Clean your room" "Close the door"
For the subject line, rule of thumb is 50 chars with 72 being a hard limit.
Anything over 72 chars is cut off and replaced with elipses.
Wrap the body at 72 chars and use the body to explain the what and why, not how.
The how should be explained by code while the commit message provides context as to why.
